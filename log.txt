    Add voltage calculation and model makes sense
    
    Obviously not perfect and will need plenty of tweaking but seems viable

    Nm is probably wrong
    
    I don't like how I've calculated it

    Tried steady state reaction rate and adjusted time, no luck
    
    Also added Cac against cel density plot

    We will fix the weird results
    
    First step is to examine all the equations to make sure they are correct

    Add plot of acetate conc against time for model verification
    
    Will allow me to see weird results easier than checking matrix values

    Changed operational parameters to be inline with Zheng
    
    As a result, reaction rates stay at 0 which  isn't ideal

    Doesn't calculate all things but need to adjust parameters and start making figures

    Implemented reaction rates - big changes
    
    This one wasn't fun
    
    ADded the reaction rates , overpotentials and cation flux as mentioned in Zheng
    
    Most of the constant values were taken from the paper directly
    
    Some were madeup and will need to replaced
    
    Caluculated molar flux from conc in cathode times cathode volume
    
    Used that to find cell current density
    
    Used current density to find overpotentials at anode and cathode

    Cathode mass balance work and constants - Issue with current density
    
    How am I supposed to implement it, Zheng was not clear enough
    
    Using solutions from other papers may add unknown/incompatible assumptions

    Anode mass balance equations from Zheng
    
    Decided not to use the function handle methode and instead use a technique similar to what I learnt in numerical
    
    Some parameters are made up and some are from Zheng
